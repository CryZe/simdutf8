# simdutf8 â€“ High-speed UTF-8 validation for Rust

Blazingly fast API-compatible UTF-8 validation for Rust using SIMD extensions, based on the implementation from
[simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson). Originally ported to Rust by the developers of [simd-json.rs](https://simd-json.rs).

## Disclaimer
This software should be considered alpha quality and should not (yet) be used in production though it has been tested
with sample data as well as a fuzzer and there are no known bugs. It will be tested more rigorously before the first
production release.

## Quick start
Add the dependency to your Cargo.toml file:
```toml
[dependencies]
simdutf8 = { version = "0.0.1"}
```

Use it just like `std::str::from_utf8`:
```rust
use simdutf8::basic::{from_utf8, Utf8Error};

println!("{}", from_utf8(b"I \xE2\x9D\xA4\xEF\xB8\x8F UTF-8!").unwrap());
```

Put `simdutf8 = "0.0.1"` in your Cargo.toml file and use `simdutf8::basic::from_utf8` as a drop-in replacement for
`std::str::from_utf8()`. If you need the extended information on validation failures use `simdutf8::compat::from_utf8`
instead.

## Features
* Written in pure Rust
* Up to twenty times faster than the std library on non-ASCII, up to twice as fast on ASCII
* Up to 28 % faster on non-ASCII input compared to the original simdjson implementation
* Supports AVX2 and SIMD implementations on x86 and x86-64, ARMv7 and ARMv8 neon support is planned
* Selects the fastest implementation at runtime based on CPU support
* No dependencies
* No-std support
* `basic` API for the fastest validation, optimized for valid UTF-8
* `compat` API as a plug-in replacement for `std::str::from_utf8()`
* Falls back to the excellent std implementation if SIMD extensions are not supported

## APIs

### Basic flavor
For maximum speed on valid UTF-8 use the `basic` api flavor. It is fastest on valid UTF-8 but only checks
for errors after processing the whole byte sequence and does not provide detailed information if the data
is not valid UTF-8. `simdutf8::basic::Utf8Error` is a zero-sized error struct.

### Compat flavor
The `compat` flavor is fully API-compatible with `std::str::from_utf8`. In particular `simdutf8::compat::from_utf8()`
returns a `simdutf8::compat::Utf8Error` which has the `valid_up_to()` and `error_len()` methods. The first is useful
for verification of streamed data. It also fails early: errors are checked on-the-fly as the string is processed and once
an invalid UTF-8 sequence is encountered, it returns without processing the rest of the data.

## Implementation selection
The fastest implementation is selected at runtime using the `std::is_x86_feature_detected!` macro unless the targeted
CPU supports AVX 2. Since this is the fastest implementation it is called directly. So if you compile with
`RUSTFLAGS=-C target-cpu=native` on a recent machine the AVX 2 implementation is used automatically.

For no-std support (compiled with `--no-default-features`) the implementation is selected based on the supported
target features. Use `RUSTFLAGS=-C target-cpu=avx2` to use the AVX 2 implementation or `RUSTFLAGS=-C target-cpu=sse4.2`
for the SSE 4.2 implementation.

If you want to be able to call the individual implementation directly, use the `public_imp` feature flag. The validation
implementations are then accessible via `simdutf8::(basic|compat)::imp::x86::(avx2|sse42)::validate_utf8()`.

## When not to use
If you are only processing short byte sequences (less than 64 bytes) the excellent scalar algorithm in standard
library is likely faster. If there is no native implementation for your platform (yet) use the standard library
instead. This library uses unsafe code which has not been battle-tested and should not (yet) be used in production.

## Benchmarks

The benchmarks have been done with [criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html), the tables
are created with [critcmp](https://github.com/BurntSushi/critcmp). Source code and data are in the 
[bench directory](https://github.com/rusticstuff/simdutf8/tree/main/bench)

The name schema is id-charset/size. _0-empty_ is the empty byte slice, _x-error/66536_ is a 64KiB slice where the very 
first character is invalid UTF-8. All benchmarks were run on a Laptop with an Intel Core i7-10750H CPU (Comet Lake) on
Windows with Rust 1.51.0.

### std library vs simdutf8 basic UTF-8 validation
![critcmp stimdutf8 basic vs std lib](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rusticstuff/simdutf8/main/img/basic-vs-std.png)
simdutf-8 performs better except for inputs < 64 bytes.

### std library vs simdjson UTF-8 validation
![critcmp st lib vs stimdutf8 basic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rusticstuff/simdutf8/main/img/basic-vs-simdjson.png)
simdutf-8 performs better compared with the simdjson except for some crazy optimization by clang for the pure ASCII
loop (to be investigated). simdjson is compiled using clang and gcc provided with MSYS.

### simdjson basic vs simdjson UTF-8 validation
![critcmp st lib vs stimdutf8 basic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rusticstuff/simdutf8/main/img/basic-vs-compat.png)
There is a performance penalty to continuously checking the error status while processing data.

## Technical details
The implementation is similar to the one in simdjson except that it aligns reads to the block size of the
SIMD extension leading to better peak performance compared to the implementation in simdjson. Since this alignment
means that an incomplete block needs to be processed before the aligned data is read this would lead to worse
performance on short byte sequences. Thus, aligned reads are only used with 2048 bytes of data or more. Incomplete
reads for the first unaligned and the last incomplete block are done in two aligned 64-byte buffers.

For the compat API we need to check the error buffer on each 64-byte block instead of just aggregating it. If an
error is found the last bytes of the previous block are checked for a cross-block continuation and then
`std::str::from_utf8()` is run to find the exact location of the error.

Care is taken that all functions are properly inlined up to the public interface.

## Thanks
* to the authors of [simdjson] for coming up with the high-performance SIMD implementation.
* to the authors of the [simdjson Rust port]() who did most of the heavy lifting of porting the C++ code to Rust.
